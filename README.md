**Rec**ommendations as you type.

[Demo](http://orgsync.github.com/rec) | [Tests](http://orgsync.github.com/rec/test)

## Install

Rec's two dependencies are jQuery and Underscore, so include them before Rec.

```html
<link rel='stylesheet' href='https://raw.github.com/orgsync/olay/master/rec.css'>
<script src='https://raw.github.com/orgsync/olay/master/rec.js'></script>
```

...or use [bower](https://github.com/twitter/bower)...

```
bower install red
```

...and get the JavaScript and CSS files from `components/rec/rec.js` and
`components/rec/rec.css` respectively.
